   cookiecutter https://github.com/Painkiller995/Cookiecutter-Django-React-Vite
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to provide your project details.

4. After generating the project, navigate into the project directory:

5. Initialize a Git repository, add your code, and push to your chosen remote:

   ```bash
   git init

## Not a React developer?

If you're not working with React, no worries! The frontend is separated and not tightly coupled to the backend. Feel free to delete the content of the frontend folder and use your favorite Vite template. Just make sure to use the same commands in the package.json file for "dev" and "build".
